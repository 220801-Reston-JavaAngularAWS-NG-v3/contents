## Git – Group activity

**Activity name:** Git Collaboration - Basic

**Team size:** 3

**Purpose of the activity:** To understand how to collaborate and contribute code to a common project (codebase) using git within a team.

**Requirements:** GitHub account, Git installed in local, an IDE to work with the project

## How to execute:

1.  Let’s call the team members as Member1, Member2, Member3 and let Member1 be the person responsible for managing/creating/merging the remote repository in GitHub.
2.  First, Member1 should create an organization called git-exercise-2 in his/her GitHub account.
3.  Next, Member1 should create a remote repository (can be private or public) called practice-git-with-java-project in the organization git-exercise-2.
4.  Now Member1 should clone the remote repository to his/her local repository.
5.  Next Member1 should create an empty java project inside the local repository.
6.  Next Member 1 should push the project from local repository to remote repository.
7.  After the empty java project is made available in the remote repository, Member1 can add Member2 and Member3 as members (members can also be added before the empty java project was pushed by Member1) to this repository practice-git-with-java-project. By doing so Member1 and Member2 will be able to contribute code to the repository created in this organization. And Member1 by default will be able to contribute to the repository as he/she will be the owner.
8.  Now Member1 should share the repository link with Member2 and Member3.
9.  Now Member2 and Member3 can clone the project to their local computer.
10. And they can import the project into eclipse.
11. Now any one member let’s say Member3 can finish one of the java assignments listed below and push the code to the remote repository.
12. Now all the members can see the java assignment completed by Member3 in the remote repository but the local repository of Member2 and Member1 does not reflect the changes pushed to remote repository by Member3. For this, Member2 and Member1 should pull the code from the remote repository to bring it to their local repository. Now in Member2 and Member1’s respective eclipse, the java assignment (completed by Member3) will be visible.
13. Likewise, the other 2 members (Member2 and Member1) can repeat the same steps one after the other.
14. Finally, we should be able to see 3 java assignments completed by the 3 team members in the remote repository. So now we can say that all the team members have contributed code to the same project (codebase) in a remote repository. In real-time projects you would not be contributing java assignments, rather you would be contributing/completing a feature/functionality/requirement of the application/project.

## Further exploration:

1.  What if all the team members work with their own java assignment simultaneously and push the code? Will it be successful? Or will it show an error? If so how do we fix it?
2.  The git commands required for the above steps would have been completed in GitBash. How would it be if we do in through GitHub Desktop? Easy? Difficult? Same?
3.  What if Member1 did not add Member2 and Member3 as collaborators? Will they still be able to contribute code to the remote repository created by Member1? Hint: Should learn about pull request in git.
