## 1. DevOps vs. Agile

-   Both DevOps and agile are modern software development practices aimed at providing a framework to produce a part of a product, a launch, or a release.

## 2. Understanding the Difference

-   Although both DevOps and agile result in the development of software, they have different approaches, involve different groups and departments, and structure production differently.
-   The most important thing to know about DevOps versus agile is that they are not mutually exclusive.
-   DevOps is a culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software.
-   Agile can be described as a development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.
-   Although DevOps and agile are different, when used together these two methodologies lead to greater efficiency and more reliable results.
-   The information below will help you gain a broader understanding of the key similarities and differences between DevOps and agile.

| **DevOps definition** DevOps is a software development practice that brings people, process, and technology together to deliver continuous value. The approach is divided into planning and tracking, development, build and test, delivery, and monitoring and operations. DevOps is unique in that development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security teams work together to create efficiency across all tasks involved in launching a new product, release, or update. | **Agile definition** Agile development is a delivery approach that relates to lean manufacturing. The fundamentals of agile center around creating a working prototype or build amidst the realities of changing needs and requirements. Bridging the gap between the development team and the end user, adaptability is a core attribute of agile, giving precedence to the needs of users and stakeholders over rigid plans. |
| **DevOps philosophy and focus** Rooted in stability, consistency, and planning, the DevOps culture seeks to identify new ways to improve and streamline processes. As a result, DevOps focuses on maximizing efficiency, identifying programmable processes, and increasing automation.                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Agile philosophy and focus** The fail-fast mindset of agile centers around adaptability and keeping pace with customer needs and expectations. Features are described as user stories, placing the focus on the individual user, what he or she needs, and why.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **DevOps scope** DevOps represents the intersections of development, operations, and quality assurance. Cross-disciplinary teams unite and collaborate in the development and delivery of software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Agile scope** Agile development is specific to the development team, its productivity, and its progress toward completing the project at hand. Development is completed in incremental sprints, and software delivery, deployment, or ongoing maintenance of each release is managed by different teams.                                                                                                                     |

## 3. How DevOps and agile work together

-   Both DevOps and agile offer a structure and framework that can speed software delivery.
-   You do not need to choose between DevOps or agile—instead, you can make use of both methodologies.
-   Agile is strong on methods to organize work, such as through Scrum or Kanban, and DevOps drives a broader culture of getting software delivered faster and more reliably.
-   Instead of a decision of DevOps versus agile, the question—actually—is how to practice both.
-   When considering how to build a development practice with the best of DevOps and agile, here are some examples of key benefits and features that can help you create a highly optimized development environment.
